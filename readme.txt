## My Process

It was especially great to notice that I am making progress. I am getting more and more familiar with thinking in coding logic. This resulted in me working more efficiently on this project compared to previous ones. 


The PokeDex is work in progress: more features/functionalities will be added later. I am satisfied with the way it looks for now. Can't wait to add more cool features to this project!
