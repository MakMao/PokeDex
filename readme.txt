## Overview

Building a PokeDex brings up awesome childhood memories. Therefore, it was a lot of fun to work on this project!

## My Process

It was especially great to notice that I am making progress. I am getting more and more familiar with thinking in coding logic. This resulted in me working more efficiently on this project compared to previous ones. 

The PokeDex is work in progress: more features/functionalities will be added later. I am satisfied with the way it looks for now. Can't wait to add more cool features to this project! 

This is a project I have been working on a while ago: I simply forgot to put it on GitHub.
