## Overview

Building a PokeDex brings up awesome childhood memories. Therefore, it was a lot of fun to work on this project!

## My Process

It was especially great to notice that I am making progress. I am getting more and more familiar with thinking in coding logic. This resulted in me working more efficiently on this project compared to previous ones. 

The PokeDex is work in progress: more features/functionalities will be added later. I am satisfied with the way it looks for now. Can't wait to add more cool features to this project! 

What I don't like is that it takes quite some time before the entire website is rendered. Would love to know how I can make that happen. At this point in time, I don't really know.
